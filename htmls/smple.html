                    <h2 id="ab">Talking about Sharks</h2>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Helo, if you think we are gonna talk about the Sharks that lives Underlands, then you're wrong you're totally Wrong!!<br>
                    Here, we are just Gossiping about some Sharks you never Knew. Here there are 3 Sharks and 1 <span class="unq">King Shark</span>.
                    <br><br><b>The First Shark</b> - Stab Shark<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;This Shark has a Too too much Violent history.Now, just take an Important note that, here there is no Gender or Face Reveal is gonna happen.
                    Now let's start a Gossip on this Shark. This Shark has a Sharp Nose with which it jumped upside down into a Swimming Pool to destroy the Life of a Shark toy
                    just without it's Consience. This made his Daughter cry so hard. This incedent had it get thrown from it's den by the Dada of Mrs Stap. It Caught him dying 
                    with Wine. And that was the Day it met <span class="unq">King Shark</span>, it's life was totally Changed.
                    <br><br><b>The Second Shark</b> - Duck Shark<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Even this Shark has a Tragedic past, but the Story line is toooo weaker than Stap Shark. Let's Start from the Scratch, When it was kid it lost its 
                    Parents in a Accidental dive into the Deep Ocean. The Emergency team just found it's Mother's Chain and Father's Kappu. By the end of the week of this Incedent,
                     Duck Shark was sent to an Orphan, it lost it's thoughts on Parents and Started Gambling in the Orphan and was arrested. But Fortunately, it was saved by the Hands of 
                    <span class="unq">King Shark</span> and now, it's living a Better life.
                    <br><br><b>The Final Shark</b> -  Flee Shark<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;To be true to Heart, this Shark is a real great Shark. In the Past it was a great Criminal and was yet to get arrested. But <span class="unq">King Shark</span>
                     Guarded it from getting Arrested and made it to get Better. Our World says 'The More Power we gain, The More Responsibility we get', but this shark became the Head of Family once,
                     but took Zero Responsibilites which made it's own family to Irrespect it. This made it get Stressed and met Stab Shark at a Wine Shop, made a Chaos in the Shop was Arrested for 10 days.
                    But nothing changed, it repeated the same thing 'Eat, Drink, Start Chaos, get Arrested', but one day the King Blessed it. The Life Changed forever.
                     <br><h3>The <span class="unq">King Shark</span></h3>
                    This Shark is a True Legend , that always gives only the Best, Best, <b>Best!</b> forever. There is no details about <span class="unq">King Shark</span>.<br><br>
